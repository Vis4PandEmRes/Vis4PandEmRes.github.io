<p><strong>Communicating complex and changing science in a pandemic</strong></p>

<p>One of the greatest challenges in the pandemic involved ensuring the sensible interpretation and communication of risk within the community. The misunderstanding of risks associated with COVID-19 and with the new vaccines has been central to the polarisation of the views, as expressed in the media and on social media in particular. Both the under- and over-estimation of risk are equally problematic with individuals at opposite ends of the spectrum risking not taking appropriate actions to prevent illness, or taking extreme precautions that can come with their own risks, for example through extended social or economic isolation, and sustained high levels of anxiety. The misunderstandings exposed during the pandemic has not been limited to the general public, with some ‘experts’ also misinterpreting or miscommunicating risks. This, combined with ambiguities concerning risks, has provided an ideal platform for those wishing to deliberately spread misinformation. Data visualisation can be a powerful tool in explaining and communicating risk.</p>
